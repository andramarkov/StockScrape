## Rules for stock trading 
This program is written on the basis of the following rules:

1. When a stock falls 8% from purchase value, it gets sold. No exceptions. This will ensure that all losses get cut as short as possible,
instead of holding on and making it worse.
2. When a stock rises 20% from purchase value, it gets sold, UNLESS it rose that in less than four weeks. If it rises 20% in less than
four weeks, hold on for 8 weeks total and then reevaluate.
3. Only purchase stocks on the way up, never on the way down. If you buy a stock you already have invested in, do so only if it has risen
in value. Never average down.
4. Don't buy a common stock listed for less than $15.
5. Generally, try to buy fewer shares of a higher priced stock, rather than more shares of a lower priced one.
6. When buying stocks, do so based on price and value charts. Ignore book value, dividend, PE ratio.
